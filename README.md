### Production Decisions

| Product | In-House | Outsourced |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Face Cream | 0 | 12,000 |
| Body Cream | 1,000 (Shift 1) | 7,000 |
| Hand Cream | 18,000 (In-house) | 0 |

---

### Key Observations

- Face Cream is fully outsourced despite slightly lower in-house cost per unit.
- Hand Cream is produced entirely in-house.
- Body Cream is partially outsourced.
- Scents & Colors and Emulsifiers are binding constraints.
- Water and Oil show slack.

# 📊 Sensitivity Analysis

## 🔎 Reduced Costs

- FS1 reduced cost: 19.5979  
  → Its cost must drop by $19.60 per unit before it becomes viable.

- HS12 reduced cost: 0.4625  
  → Small cost reduction could make it viable.

Variables with reduced cost = 0 are already optimal in solution.

## 📉 Shadow Prices

### Scents & Colors

Shadow price: **–$50.96**

Interpretation:
Each additional pound reduces total cost by $50.96.

Recommendation:
Increase availability of scents & colors.

---

### Hand Cream Demand

Shadow price: **$47.22**

Producing one additional unit increases total cost by $47.22 (within allowable range).

---

## 📌 Stability Ranges

- Face Cream outsourcing remains optimal unless outsourcing cost increases by $19.60+
- Production mix remains stable within allowable increase/decrease ranges

# 💡 Strategic Insights

### 1️⃣ Outsourcing Strategy

- Face Cream outsourcing is cost-effective due to labor/material bottlenecks
- Body Cream outsourcing is expensive and should be minimized
- Hand Cream should remain fully in-house

---

### 2️⃣ Resource Allocation

- Increase scents & colors inventory
- Reduce excess water and oil stock
- Reevaluate shift structure for better capacity utilization

---

### 3️⃣ Managerial Recommendation

RCI should:

- Continue outsourcing face cream
- Prioritize in-house production of body cream when feasible
- Increase constrained raw materials
- Explore incremental labor expansion if demand grows
